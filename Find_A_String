Constraints


Each character in the string is an ascii character.

Output Format

Output the integer number indicating the total number of occurrences of the substring in the original string.

Sample Input

CDC
Sample Output

<code>

def count_substring(string, sub_string):
    i=0
    count=0
    while(i+(len(sub_string)-1)<len(string)):
        str1=""
        for j in range(len(sub_string)):
            str1 += string[j+i]
        if(str1==sub_string):
            count +=1
        i+=1

        
    return count
